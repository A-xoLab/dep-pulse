# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

- `0.1.0` and newer: ✅ Supported
- Older versions: ❌ Not supported

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately. Do not open a public issue.

### Preferred Method: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/A-xoLab/dep-pulse/security) of this repository
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"** button
3. Fill out the private security advisory form

This creates a private draft security advisory that only repository maintainers can see.

### Alternative Method: Private Issue

If the "Report a vulnerability" button is not available, you can:
1. Open a new issue on GitHub
2. Add the `security` label (if you have permission) or mention "SECURITY" in the title
3. We will convert it to a private security advisory

### Information to Include

When reporting, please include:
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Affected extension version
- VS Code version and OS
- Any logs or stack traces
- Potential impact assessment

## Response Time

- Acknowledgement: within 3 business days
- Initial assessment: within 7 business days
- Patch or mitigation: prioritized by severity

## Scope

This policy covers the DepPulse VS Code extension and its published artifacts. Third-party dependencies should be reported to their maintainers directly, but we will coordinate if needed.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure. We will keep you informed of progress and coordinate a public advisory once a fix is available.
